# HRS
In this project I tried to simplify the basics of OOP by implementing a very simple and direct structure of HR system
The project consists mainly of the main abstract class called BaseEmployee which contains general properties and functionalities of an employee.

There are four different types of employees each of which has it's own class and implementation, and inherits a general behavior from the BaseEmployee Class.
The four types are:
1-Anonymous -> Represents an anonymous type of employee
2-Employee  -> Represents a typical employee
3-Manager   -> Represents a typical manager
4-CEO       -> Represents a typical CEO
